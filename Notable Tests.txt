achieved 0.653 on the 3 agent case with a final AD = 0.1 with pop=100
above result no reproducable consistently on different seeds

increasing pop size t0 250 did nothing noticable over another 12 hour run 
finished with 0.630 and alpha delta 0.1

trying with alpha_delta = 0.01 to see if this affects ability to get good network
keeping pop at 100, was unable to acheive a groves' function, final fitness = -0.0475 (error).

setting init_alpha_delta back to 0.1 and changing the way that alpha_delta is decreased: 
it used to decrease when achieved_alpha ~ alpha, but it will now decrease when 
it gets a viable groves function.

I rewrote the multiprocessing more optimised by moving initialisation outside of the pnr-worker code.

I have now noticed that increasing the populatin size to 10000 (100x) only increases the iteration time by 3x-4x
so this should be making evolution much faster. This causes the time to increase a lot for the first ~100 iterations
before the stagnation can kick in (50 iteration stagnation protection)

Due to the above, i am now performing worst case analysis every iteration.

ive implemented gpu passes to compute agaist all profiles at once, this also lets me use more profiles to
converge faster, since this now (mostly) avoids the whach-a-mole situation from before
