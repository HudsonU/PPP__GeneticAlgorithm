achieved 0.653 on the 3 agent case with a final AD = 0.1 with pop=100
above result no reproducable consistently on different seeds

increasing pop size t0 250 did nothing noticable over another 12 hour run 
finished with 0.630 and alpha delta 0.1

trying with alpha_delta = 0.01 to see if this affects ability to get good network
keeping pop at 100, was unable to acheive a groves' function, final fitness = -0.0475 (error).

setting init_alpha_delta back to 0.1 and changing the way that alpha_delta is decreased: 
it used to decrease when achieved_alpha ~ alpha, but it will now decrease when 
it gets a viable groves function.

didnt do anything, from now ill just keep it as is, making init hidden nodes =5 for n=3
